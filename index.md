# Book:
### Data Mining and Analysis: Fundamental Concepts and Algorithms:
This book introduces us to the basics of data mining, analysis and then proceeds on to various machine learning algorithms like K-means,Decision trees,K-means etc. The reason i am interested in this book was first mainly the title. Since a data scientist spends most of his time on cleaning,mining and Analysis of data I thought this would be a great place to start. The book was also tagged as a "Beginner" book which made me think it will be easier for me to follow.
